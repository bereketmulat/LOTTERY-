        <h1>ABOUT DUBAI</h1>

        <p>
          Dubai, city and capital of the emirate of Dubai, one of the wealthiest
          of the seven emirates that constitute the federation of the United
          Arab Emirates, which was created in 1971 following independence from
          Great Britain. There are several theories about the origin of the name
          Dubai. One associates it with the daba—a type of locust that infests
          the area—while another holds that it refers to a market that existed
          near the city. In recent years Dubai has been compared to Singapore
          and Hong Kong and is often regarded as the Middle East’s premier
          entrepôt. Area 13.5 square miles (35 square km). Pop. (2017 est.)
          2,919,178. Palm Jumeirah Palm JumeirahPalm Jumeirah, Dubai, United
          Arab Emirates, photographed from the International Space Station,
          2005. The western area of Dubai benefits from small stretches of sandy
          beaches, which have helped to catalyze the city’s tourism industry.
          Dubai’s rulers have sought to increase the city’s limited seafronts,
          and, in the absence of natural offshore islands, developers were
          encouraged to construct giant man-made islands off the coast of the
          city. The most famous of these is Palm Jumeirah, which has the shape
          of a palm tree. Others include the “World” islands, a cluster of small
          islands positioned to resemble a world map when viewed from above.
          City site and layout
        </p>

        <p>
          The new city centre is a string of skyscrapers lining Sheikh Zayed
          Road. Notable among these are the Emirates Towers, which were built in
          the late 1990s and early 2000s and which house a hotel and government
          offices. Close to Sheikh Zayed Road is the Dubai International
          Financial Centre, housed in a futuristic arch-shaped building, and the
          Burj Khalifa, which at the time of its official opening in 2010 was
          the world’s tallest building; it was named after the president of the
          United Arab Emirates and emir of Abu Dhabi, Khalifa ibn Zayed Al
          Nahyan. To the west of the skyscrapers lie several affluent suburbs,
          most of which house substantial villas. On their periphery lies the
          Burj al-ʿArab, a giant sail-shaped tower which is home to a luxury
          hotel. Farther west are new clusters of skyscrapers surrounding a
          man-made marina and several man-made lakes.

            <p>
              The Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world, soaring
              2,717 feet (828 meters) high with more than 160 stepped floors
              that narrow as it climbs syringe-like to the sky. Designed to pay
              homage to the complex geometry of Islamic art, the Burj Khalifa
              brings a new meaning to the term skyscraper and is a highlight of
              the massive downtown Dubai complex.

            <p>
              Carved along the Gulf shoreline south of Dubai’s The Palm island,
              Dubai Marina is a skyscraper-packed waterfront community that’s
              one of the city’s swishest residential and leisure hotspots. At
              its heart is a 2-mile (3-kilometer) waterway framed by residential
              blocks, hotels, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues.

            <p>
              The sail-like silhouette of the Burj Al-Arab Jumeirah has become a
              symbol of Dubai's opulence and affluence, standing at 1,053 feet
              (321 meters) as the third-tallest hotel and one of the most
              luxurious hotels in the United Arab Emirates. Opened in 1999, the
              landmark boasts plenty of superlatives, including its seven-star
              status.
